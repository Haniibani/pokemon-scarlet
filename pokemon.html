                <h2> Sprigatito </h2>
                <p>
                    Sprigatito is pretty darn adorable, but its Grass-typing and moves mean it's not going to be a ton of help for the first few gyms 
                    (Bug, Grass). However, if you're planning on taking on the Stony Cliff Titan first, 
                    Sprigatito will hold the advantage over the Rock-type Pokémon you'll encounter. 
                    Of the three starters, this kitty has the highest base Speed stat, 
                    as well as a decently high Physical Attack stat. But it does have the most weaknesses out of the three Starters, 
                    being susceptible to Bug, Fire, Flying, Ice, and Poison-type moves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At level 16 Sprigatito evolves into Floragato, and its final evolution at level 36: Meowscarada. 
                    It gains a secondary Dark typing here, meaning it gains access to some strong Dark-type moves, 
                    but it also gains weaknesses to Fighting and Fairy-types, and a 4x weakness to the common Bug-type. 
                    But Sprigatito is great for the Titan fights in particular — Flying one notwithstanding.

                <h2> Floragato </h2>
                <p>
                    Floragato is a bipedal, feline Pokémon. Its body is mostly covered in long light green fur, 
                    with green ear tips and a short fluffy tail. It has a growth of green fur on its neck, 
                    which extends at the front and droops down to its hips, resembling a poncho. 
                    Dark green colorations adorn the lower part of this neck fur, along with its hands, feet, and face; 
                    the latter is patterned to resemble a mask. Its face also has pink eyes and a small pink nose. 
                    Floragato's fur can change in hardness depending on its mood — its fur becomes sharp as needles 
                    when it is ready to battle. Each of its hands and feet has a round, pink paw pad and three digits, 
                    with visible claws on its fingers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a vine tucked inside Floragato's fur, which has a hard, round, pink flower bud on the end. 
                    Floragato wields the vine and swings the bud to attack its opponents.
                    When not in use, the bud is kept on the left side of Floragato's chest, near its neck.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Floragato is intelligent and dexterous. It is also mischievous and likes showing off, 
                    desiring attention and companionship from others. If its Trainer refuses to give it attention, 
                    Floragato may misbehave by pulling pranks, such as tying the Trainer with its vine while they are asleep.
                </p>

                <h2> Meowscarada</h2>
                <p> 
                    Meowscarada is a humanoid feline Pokémon with light green fur covering most of its body — 
                    stopping just above its long, dark green legs — and a short, fluffy tail. 
                    The fur is especially longer around its ears, thighs, and arms, the latter resembling poofy sleeves. 
                    Its face has lazy pink eyes and a small pink nose, and is covered in a four-pointed mask-like shape, 
                    with a pattern of three green diamonds on it. Each of its hands has three fingers tipped with green claws, 
                    as well as a pink paw pad. On its neck is a pink collar resembling flower petals. 
                    This collar holds together its cape, which grows from the leaves it had around its neck as Floragato.
                    The cape is lined with reflective fur, is black on the outside and green on the inside, 
                    and splits into two near the base, with both parts of the cape ending in fleur-de-lis shapes.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Meowscarada carries a four-petaled green flower, whose stem is hidden by the reflective fur on its cape, 
                    creating the illusion of floating. The flower can blossom into a round, pollen-filled flower bomb, 
                    with a two-tone green and black zigzag pattern on the outside, and six petals adorning the top. 
                    In a battle, Meowscarada uses skillful misdirection to stealthily plant these flower bombs 
                    onto various surfaces around its foes before setting them off, catching the foes unawares.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meowscarada has a proud, showy personality; however, it is also sensitive and prone to jealousy. 
                    It can often be very attached to its Trainer, and it will become upset if its Trainer gives attention to other Pokémon.
                    Meowscarada is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Flower Trick.

                <h2> Fuecoco </h2>
                <p>
                    Fuecoco is a bipedal crocodilian Pokémon with a mostly red body and a white stomach and face. 
                    Its body contains a small flame sac, which constantly leaks fire energy due to its size. 
                    The energy releases in the form of two yellow tufts on top of its head; should Fuecoco get excited, 
                    more tufts of flame may emerge. Fuecoco has black eyes and triangular nostrils, 
                    and its mouth has three teeth, with one in the upper jaw and two in the lower jaw. 
                    It has stubby arms and large feet with two black toes on each foot. 
                    Fuecoco has yellow square scales on its stomach, back, tail, and the soles of its feet. 
                    These scales are warm to the touch, although they can become heated. 
                    The scales absorb external heat, such as from warm rocks where it lies on, to be turned into fire energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fuecoco is laid-back and does things at its own pace. It enjoys eating, and it will rush towards any food it sees.

                <h2> Crocalor </h2>
                <p>
                    Crocalor is a bipedal, crocodilian Pokémon. Its body is mostly red, but its face and chest are white, 
                    and its hands and feet are black with three digits each. It has yellow rectangular scales covering its back and tail, 
                    and a pattern of black and yellow stripes on its chest. Its face has a long snout, red square cheeks, 
                    a pattern of two red triangles resembling nostrils, and a hook-like upper jaw. 
                    When Crocalor opens its mouth, three pairs of sharp teeth can be seen lining its lower jaw. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Atop Crocalor's head is an orange mass of fire energy shaped like a nest, 
                    with yellow squares patterning it. This "nest" contains a yellow, glowing, 
                    egg-shaped fireball on top, borne out of Crocalor's fire energy and overflowing vitality. 
                    Crocalor can control the fireball, sending it out and using it for its moves. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Crocalor's internal flame sac has a valve that connects to its vocal cords. 
                    As a result, Crocalor lets out guttural cries as it releases fire from its mouth. 
                    Its voice can hardly be described as beautiful; moreover, its voice becomes more 
                    destructive as it breathes more powerful fire

                <h2> Skeledirge </h2>
                <p>
                    Skeledirge is a large, red, crocodilian Pokémon covered in rectangular scales. 
                    Its belly is angular and has a white coloration flanked by black stripes on either side, 
                    resembling an open suit jacket and dress shirt. It also has various white-colored patterns 
                    on its head, lower jaw, neck, back, shoulders, arms, legs, and the cylindrical tip of its tail. 
                    The white coloration on the top of its head resembles a lute. 
                    Skeledirge has three black claws on each foot, and although it usually walks on all fours, 
                    it is capable of standing on its hind legs. Skeledirge's head is delineated with a black 
                    circular shape at the top. It has black eyes with yellow irises and red eyelids, 
                    serrated jaws with purple insides, and various square and triangular patterns that come in red, 
                    orange, yellow, and purple. A wreath of solid orange-and-yellow fire energy emerges from 
                    the back of Skeledirge's jaws, which circles around its head. 
                    There is an orange fiery bird resting on top of Skeledirge's head, which is a separate, 
                    independent entity from the Pokémon.[1] This bird is spherical, with a yellow face, 
                    white eyes, a short crest and tail, and a singular tiny pointed "foot" it balances itself on. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is said that the bird was born when the Skeledirge had as a Crocalor gained a soul; this also gave Skeledirge its Ghost typing.
                    The bird can sometimes be seen pecking at Skeledirge's jaws. 
                    Skeledirge has a meddlesome but caring personality. Its singing is gentle, 
                    but powerful and full of vitality, capable of soothing the souls of all who hears it. 
                    Opponents hearing its singing will feel warm and fulfilled inside, losing their will to battle.
                    Skeledirge burns its enemies by unleashing flames that exceed the temperature of 5,400°F (3,000°C). 
                    As seen during its signature move Torch Song, when Skeledirge sings, 
                    the fiery bird transforms into a microphone-like shape, with its "foot" 
                    growing much longer towards the ground. Then, the bird powers up with the singing, 
                    gains fiery wings, and flies towards its enemy. Skeledirge is the only known Pokémon 
                    capable of learning the move Torch Song.

                <p>
                    Quaxly is a white duckling-like Pokémon. It has a yellow beak and blue eyes. 
                    It has teal webbed feet and a large teal coif-like crest that covers its head, 
                    with a feathery tuft in the front and a white curvy line shaped like a wave. 
                    Quaxly's coif has a smooth feel thanks to the rich, moist cream that holds it. 
                    The coif can become unkempt should it get dry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Quaxly is an earnest and tidy Pokémon, and tends to overthink things. 
                    Quaxly's feathers secrete a glossy gel which protects its body against water and grime. 
                    It hates getting itself dirty, especially on its head. 
                    Quaxly's strong legs allow it to swim without issues, even in strong currents. 
                    It also uses its legs to repeatedly kick its foes with swift speed.
                    Although found in Paldea, Quaxly is not native to the region, 
                    instead having migrated from faraway places a long time ago.

                <p>
                    Quaxwell is a white, duck-like Pokémon. Its face has blue eyes, 
                    a pointed yellow beak, and a teal brow just above it which flares into 
                    two large branches flanking a small bump in the middle. On top of Quaxwell's 
                    head is a round blue crest twice as large, which droops towards the back. 
                    Various blue and teal-colored feathers also adorn its chest, forearms, tail, 
                    and the insides of its feet. The three feathers at the end 
                    of its arms are similar to fingers. Quaxwell's legs are long and its feet are 
                    yellow with three toes each, and they wrap around its ankles in a manner that resembles ballet shoes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The crest above Quaxwell's head is capable of absorbing impacts, 
                    and is used by Quaxwell to shield itself from incoming attacks. 
                    Doing this may mess up the crest, however, which causes its body and mind to 
                    feel unwell and weakened. If its crest becomes unkempt and messy, 
                    it will quickly use gel to comb it back into shape. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Quaxwell has a serious, stoic personality. 
                    It learns and practices dance routines by observing the 
                    movements of people and Pokémon from various regions. 
                    Quaxwell is a hard worker, and constantly trains its strength and technique. 
                    Flocks of Quaxwell train by running their legs through shallow waters, 
                    and then compete with each other for the most graceful kicks

                    neck, chest, and individual tail feathers. Its face has blue eyes and a pointed yellow beak. 
                    Atop its head is a large, flowing, slick, dark blue crest, with long light blue and 
                    orange-red feathers at the front, separating the crest from the head. 
                    Its forearms have three sets of feathers, each tipped with light blue; 
                    and it has what resembles hands with three "fingers" each. 
                    Additional light blue accents decorate its waist and legs. 
                    Its yellow feet have bulbous segments with three toes each; 
                    the front-most segments are orange in color. It has a defined rump and an elaborate-looking tail, 
                    with a circular base and three teardrop-shaped feathers decorating it at the top, 
                    along with two chains consisting of three feathers flanking it on either side.
                </p>

                    In battle, Quaquaval is accompanied with a series of teardrop-shaped decorative water feathers, 
                    which are ejected from the organs on its tail feathers and fanned out behind its back. 
                    When attacking, these water feathers move forward and spin around Quaquaval's body, 
                    making a buzzsaw-like arrangement that it uses to slice into its enemies. 
                    Quaquaval's legs are well-trained and have incredible strength, 
                    being able to launch a truck away with a single kick. It uses its legs to perform dance moves, 
                    some of which appear to be based on dances from faraway lands. Quaquaval is viewed by Tsareena as its rival.

                    Quaquaval has a cheerful and energetic disposition, dancing away no matter what situation it faces. 
                    However, it is also stoic and very serious, especially when it comes to consistently polishing its skills. 
                    It can become very focused during critical situations. 
                    Quaquaval is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Aqua Step.
