colors.

## Technologies used

- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

## Testing 

Test has been conducted using Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Safari. Testing different devices and screen resolutions has been conducted using Google DevTools.

Listed is the main issues discovered.

1. Home page Hero-Images was not responsive enough for smaller screen sizes.
 - Solution: added a combined picture as a hero for smaller screens, as the hovering effect wont work on mobiles anyways i simply added a zoom effect.
2. The hero text would cover the navbar when scrolling down.
 - Solution: added z-index to make sure navbar was in front of hero.
3. Logo text not responsive enough for small screens.
 - Solution: Resized the font-size to a smaller size from 380px and down.
4. Pokemon page not responsive enough.
 - Solution: Added flexwrapping to make sure pictures got ahead of the text. Aswell as separating text by paragraph.
5. Menu not working properly on small screens and it gets cropped and divided.
 - Solution: Added a "hamburger" to smaller screen sizes.

Other than these issues i have come across minor issues while coding. Most of them are due to misspelled attributes, tags or similar mistakes.
